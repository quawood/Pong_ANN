# Pong_ANN
Using genetic algorithm to evolve species to play pong



This project attempts to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can play a classic game of Pong. I try to achieve this by using a genetic 
algorithm where each agent in the environment has an associated move controller that is an ANN. The weights of these neural networks are then evolved in the next generation.
By using a fitness function that is a function of the scores that each agent receives when playing pong.

Currently, I am evolving this species up to the 30th generation and I am awaiting the results
